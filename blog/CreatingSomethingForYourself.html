      <h1>Creating something for yourself</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>When was the last time you actually did something for yourself?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Not for others' approval, not for money, not because someone told you it was a good idea.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You do it because you simply want to explore, because you feel you have to do it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There's something within you that's begging you to act on it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Remember when you were a kid and started drawing cool characters.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When you started writing stories about heroes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When you explored your interests without anyone judging you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There's beauty in doing things for yourself, you can never fail if you do it for you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What about the feeling of proudness?</p>
      <br>
      <p>There's nothing more beautiful than following your instincts and learning about yourself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Every time you do something for yourself and share it with the world you grow a little.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Keep doing that until you achieve freedom.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Because one day, you'll create something that's even bigger than you.</p>
